## Introduction
Reactionary Measures is a mod that aims to add advanced, more realistic nuclear engineering into Factorio, that integrates well with other power-hungry mods without being overbearing.

In order to be compatible with larger overhauls, no new ores are added. Only new recipes, items and buildings that are obtainable with base-game resources. 

Development of this project started in mid 2021, so although this mod may not have been completed then, I can confidently say I had the idea first :) 

NOTE: Although I have taken a great deal of time to research and develop this mod, I am not a real nuclear scientist and have taken liberties in certain chemical reactions to spare players the burden of true realism. Expect a close but by no means true-to-life representation of nuclear physics. 

**Terms:**
	*Process*
		A *process* is a set of recipes that turn multiple ingredients into one or more desired outputs. The recipes can be spread across multiple buildings, and items may only be specific to one *process*. There are several *processes* within RM, and they will be discussed in detail.


## Mining
Using the Leach Mill, you can mine

## Modular Nuclear Reactor
At this point, you have done everything from separating hydrogen from fluoride to spinning uranium really fast. With your new fuel, you
